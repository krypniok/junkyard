# !!! BEWARE OF !!! 

## rndmovie.sh (max seconds)

It's fun to watch a meshup of all your videos.
Change directory to your Video's and call the script with (MAX SECONDS) which means RANDOM between 1 and MAX SECONDS.
----

Of course you need to install

`
sudo apt install ffmpeg mpv
`

before.

You even don't have to download anything if you just enter

`
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krypniok/junkyard/main/rndmovie/rndmovie.sh) 3
`

within the root directory where you have your videos and subdirectories.

## playmovie.sh (searchword)
----
Plays a Video (or all Video's in a row, i don't know) that matches (searchword)
#

## moviescript.sh

Make up a new MOvie by cutting scenes together.
The file "input.txt" is read and self-explanatory.
